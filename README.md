# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project is a handwritten digit recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks. The system can recognize digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy. The project is implemented using Python programming language and several machine learning libraries.

# Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used for this project. It is a widely used dataset for machine learning and computer vision research. The dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. The images are 28x28 pixels in size, and each pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255.

# Languages and Libraries
The project is implemented using Python programming language and several machine learning libraries including:

 * Numpy
 * TensorFlow
 * Matplotlib
 * Tkinter
 * PIL

#Graphical User Interface (GUI)
A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed for this project to test the model with new images. The GUI is developed using Tkinter and PIL libraries. The user can select an image from the local machine and the model predicts the digit in the image.


Handwritten digit recognition is an essential task in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project demonstrates the use of convolutional neural networks for handwritten digit recognition. The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, and the GUI provides an easy way to test the model with new images.
